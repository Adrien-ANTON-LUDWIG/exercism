# My Exercism solutions

My solutions to the [Exercism](https://exercism.org/) programming exercises. :rocket:

## Repository structure

```
.
├── README.md
└── <language>
    └── <exercice>
        └── <solution>
```

To avoid redundancy, I only include the solution files in the repository. The instructions and tests can be found on the [Exercism website](https://exercism.org/) or downloaded from the CLI.

## Languages

### In progress

## Contributing

I welcome any **constructive** and **supportive** feedback via issues.
