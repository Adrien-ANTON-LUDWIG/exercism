# Everything below makes sense on any package repository, so it's
# stuff that should be put into each such repository. The same holds
# for ".mailmap" (which some people can decide if they want to thin it
# out or not include it) and for ".gitattributes" (which is probably
# irrelevant except maybe for the core repo).
